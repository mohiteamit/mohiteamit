# 👋 Hi, I'm Amit Mohite  

🚀 **AI Enthusiast | Process Automation Expert | Machine Learning Practitioner**  

## 🛤️ My Journey  

I started as an **automation expert**, making processes faster, smarter, and more scalable. Over the years, I realized that **automation isn't just about efficiency—it's about intelligence.** That curiosity led me to the world of **AI & ML**, where data doesn't just tell a story—it predicts the future.  

Today, I work at the **intersection of automation, AI, and data science**, helping businesses unlock the power of **intelligent decision-making**.  

## 🔍 What I'm Exploring  

🔹 **Fair AI & News Recommendation** – Can we make news feeds less biased? I'm working on **graph-based models** to ensure diverse, trustworthy content exposure.  
🔹 **Generative AI & Reinforcement Learning** – Teaching machines to **think, adapt, and create** rather than just predict.  
🔹 **MLOps & AI at Scale** – Because building AI models is fun, but making them work in production is where the real challenge begins.  

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🔹 **[RIM-Weighting](https://github.com/mohiteamit/rim-weighting)**  
📌 **Industry-ready** solution for **Random Iterative Method (RIM) weighting**, aligning survey sample distributions with known population margins. **Optimized for Market Research**.  

### 🤖 **[Hand Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/mohiteamit/hand-gesture-recognition)**  
🧠 Built using **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** to classify hand gestures—because computers should understand **more than just text**.  

### 🔍 **[Ticket Classification (NLP)](https://github.com/mohiteamit/ticket-classification)**  
🏦 Automating **banking ticket classification** using **Naïve Bayes** and **topic modeling**. A blend of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and real-world automation.  

### 🚲 **[Bike Sharing Demand Prediction](https://github.com/mohiteamit/bike-sharing-demand-linear-regression)**  
📊 Leveraging **Linear Regression** and **ML models** to predict demand for bike-sharing services. Because **smart cities need smart data**.  

### 📉 **[Telecom Churn Prediction](https://github.com/mohiteamit/telecom-churn-casestudy)**  
📞 Can AI predict **which customers will leave** before they actually do? This ML project explores **churn modeling** in telecom.
